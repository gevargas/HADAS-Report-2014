% â€“ Group evolution in terms of members

\paragraph{Research group:}\

The Hadas group was formed in october 2005 as a new team for the LIG laboratory. It actually follows the STORM team, directed by M. Adiba until 1996. 
Over the years, the group  proposed an evolution of the scientific vision of a database management systems  as  a semantic-based infrastructure for managing ubiquituous and heterogeneous data services. 
The team currently includes 9 research persons (2 full professors, 5 Associate Professor and two CNRS Research Scientist) and a research engineer and 15 PHD students and post-docs. Durant this period we hired 3 persons. 

% \textit{(Free form description of how the team composition has evolved: up to 15 lines)}\\
The research activity on services has been reinforced in the group with the arrival of Noha Ibrahim, associate professor who joined the team in October 2010. 
Then, the arrival of Sihem Amer-Yahia Research (Dec 2011) and Vincent Leroy Associate Professor UJF / Research scientist (Sept 2012) brought new areas of research in the group. 
Etienne Dubl{\'e} Research Engineer (Mai 2011) helps us in developing and finalizing some of our prototypes. He also brought expertises in new kind of sensor networks and of file systems.

\paragraph{Research description and :}\

The HADAS group has contributed in the following areas: relational data models, snapshots and their semantics, active and temporal databases and object-oriented database systems. The advent of the web and middleware infrastructures in the early 1990s has profoundly changed the nature of research in databases. 
Our research is related to the changes in devices and softwares:
\begin{itemize}
\item Memories and disks with more capacity and faster access
\item faster processors snd networks
\item Algorithmic advances, eg , parallel computing
\item cloud computing (virtualization , elasticity, pay- as-you -go ...)
\end{itemize}

More recently big data management and analysis gives other more challenging prospective. These changes have reduced the cost of creating, capturing, managing and storing information of a sixth of what it was in 2005. This has allowed a scale change in size of data, distribution of data, number of connected devices, and number of users. 

Considering this globalization of data, knowledge and computing resources and because of the quality and intelligence of the expected data management functions, we have been confronted (and still confronted) with a change in the field of databases.

To face this challenges we decide to revisit database systems and consider them not anymore as centralized data storage systems but data management services largely distributed and deployed over different types of large scale systems(grids, peer-to-peer networks, sensor networks, ambient and ubiquitous environments). 
Semantics is at the heart of this approach as it is used at all levels of the process of designing or composing data services for handling autonomy, dynamic behavior and heterogeneity of both users and data sources. 

The activities of the group during these past years have been centered on the following themes:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Accessing data in large-scale systems: a first aspect concerns query optimization in distributed and dynamic systems ; a second aspect deals with mining large amounts of data to extract patterns of interest.
\item  Composing data services in a dynamic way:  we investigate models, algorithms and tools for coordinating services with non functional properties (contracts) and for providing access to heterogeneous data coming from services
\item  Reasoning on data semantics: we investigate different models and  algorithms  for querying data (or resources) through  possibly heterogeneous and distributed ontologies.
\end{itemize}

We have participated to the Optimacs and Ubiquest ANR projects that bridge the gap between data management and (web) services into a data management platform and  between networks and data management.   

We have been also involved in other ANR projects on context management for software adaptation, handling uncertainty and trust in peer-to-peer data management system. We are involved in the Datalyse project whose objective is to build a smart warehouse demonstrator for the collection, certification, integration, categorization, security, enrichment and sharing of heterogeneous Big Data  of type "Big Data User" (UBD) or from machines, of type "Big Data Monitoring" (MBD). 
We also collaborate with industry, especially with ST Microlectronics on novel data mining algorithms able to fully exploit the parallelism of multicore machines. 

Results of our research have direct impact on applications dealing with huge amounts of data and resources largely distributed in pervasive environments, such as data spaces, smartgrids and smart buildings, hardware and software observation, and the semantic Web.

\subsubsection{Accessing data in large-scale systems}
\label{optimisation}
%==========================================================================

Accessing data concerns several dimensions of large scale systems: number of resources, data volume and data complexity. It basically means using declarative queries that are optimized based on system characteristics.
Data mining is another way to query large quantities of data, by extracting interesting patterns from them. Such patterns provide meaningful abstractions of raw data, which are thus less numerous and more appropriate for data analysis. 
Globally, the difficulty for evaluating queries efficiently on nowadays applications motivates this work to revisit traditional query optimization techniques. The following presents these two aspects of accessing data in the large. It also focuses on works done on querying the social web. 

%==========================================================================
\subsubsection*{1- CBR query optimization}
%==========================================================================

Our research contributes to the development of new distributed query optimization techniques. It relies on the adaptation of machine learning, more precisely Case-Based Reasoning(CBR), and pseudo random search space exploration (also exploiting the case base) to produce efficient  query execution plans according to application specific optimization objectives expressed over resource consumption (e.g. time, energy, number of messages).  The query plan generation considered multiple optimization objectives customizable to application requirements (QoS based Hybrid Query optimization) 

These research led to the following original contributions:
\begin{itemize}

\item  A query optimization approach that use cases generated from the evaluation of similar past queries. A query case comprises: (i) the query (the problem), (ii) the query plan (the solution) and (iii) the measures of computational resources consumed during the query plan execution (the evaluation of the solution). 

\item  A query plan generation process [1] that uses classical query optimization heuristics and makes decisions randomly when information on data is not available (e.g. for ordering joins, selecting algorithms or choosing message exchange protocols). This process also exploits the CBR principle for generating plans for subqueries, thus accelerating the learning of new cases. 

\item  A Simulation Platform [2] allowing to experiment distributed query optimization and rule-based programs over a set of distributed data-enabled devices hosting virtual machines(VM). A VM integrates a query optimization engine [3] implementing the above techniques.

\subsubsection*{2- Data mining}
%==========================================================================

Data mining is the automatic extraction of unknown and potentially interesting information from large quantities of data. One of the major fields of data mining consists in discovering patterns occurring frequently (i.e. more than a given threshold) in data. 
%The data can either be unstructured data (sets of items like supermarket transactions for example) or data having a sequence, tree or graph structure (graph structured molecules for example).
The group works on pattern mining in complex data such as sequences, trees or graphs, which are found in many applications in chemistry (e.g. graphs representing molecules) or in bioinformatics (e.g. gene regulation networks).

This research focused on improving frequent pattern mining algorithms, both to make them more scalable and to apply them to real data analysis contexts. Main results are:

\begin{itemize}
\item  From the scalability point of view, we acquired a strong expertise on exploiting multicore processors for pattern mining [2, 5].
The proposed algorithms are also based on the notion of closed patterns [2, 4, 5], reducing the output size (hence the computation time) without loss of information.

\item These works culminated with the proposition of ParaMiner [2], the first parallel and generic algorithm for mining closed patterns.

\item From an application point of view, works have been done on the analysis of execution traces, in collaboration with STMicroelectronics.
They have improved the way to discover periodic behaviors and their disruption in traces [4], to rewrite a trace with a few significant sequences of events [3], and to automatically discover hotspots of memory contention in a parallel code [1].

\subsubsection*{3- Social Web Data access}
%==========================================================================

Research has been done on new exploration problems to find useful user groups in collaborative rating datasets [1,2,4] and useful information in online news [3,5]. Our formulation of exploration as an optimization problem where various dimensions such as similarity, diversity, and coverage are optimized, leads to reductions from well-known problems and adaptations well-established algorithms. Large-scale user studies have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our findings. The current research direction is to blend efficient mining with exploration and to develop an evaluation methodology for large-scale information exploration.

Social Web Data access also concerns optimization. Data is stored within data centers, which constitute distributed systems. It is therefore important to optimize communications between the machines to avoid saturating the network equipment. A first work considered the problem of data routing between users of social networks. The key idea was to identify hubs that aggregate data from several sources and reduce the number of messages exchanged [6]. A second work considers the problem of data placement in hierarchical network structures. A reactive algorithm monitors data access patterns to identify locations in which new replicas of data should be deployed to reduce routers saturation [7].

\subsubsection{Composing data services on the fly }
%==========================================================================

Composing services  exported by different organisations is a key issue when building  large scale and data-intensive systems. 
Composition requires to take into account the characteristics of  eco-systems (e.g., memory and computing, and network capabilities). The composition process uses this knowledge or semantics to dynamically discover and coordinate (ubiquitous) services, and then to adapt the coordination process depending on the availability and change of services. 
Another important challenge is to consider non functional aspects and QoS (quality of service) criteria such as availability, reliability, and temporal constraints that are crucial when composing data services in a dynamic way. We also have to consider an unlimited set of resources usable via a "pay as U go model", energy consumption or services reputation and provenance models.  

The research in this theme contributes to the construction of service based data management systems as service coordinations. Once data management is delivered as service coordinations, it can have associated non-functional properties: exception handling and recovery.
We proposed methodologies, algorithms, languages and tools for designing and executing  service coordinations respecting SLA contracts. 

We first applied our approach for the management  of queries as coordinations of services, including data services and computing.  
This leads to the following results: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  an Hybrid query model for expressing queries as data service coordinations based on workflows. It uses the abstract state machines (ASM) formalism. 

\item  a query language HSQL (Hybrid Services Query Languages) associated to the hybrid query model and the language MQLiST (Mashup Query Spatio Temporal Language) for integrating hybrid query results in a mashup. Both are extension of SQL. 

\item  an algorithm BP GYO for generating the query workflow that implements a query expressed in HSQL.

% An algorithm for computing computing the query workflows search space that implement an hybrid query and that respect an associated SLA expressed as an aggregation of measures (economic, temporal and energetic costs).

\item an hybrid query evaluation engine HYPATIA.

\end{itemize}

Another result of our research is linked with the QoS of service coordinations using active policies linked with activities of workflow .

\subsubsection{Reasoning on data semantics}
%==========================================================================
This research is focused on combining reasoning and data management for efficiently querying and linking Web data through ontologies. Ontologies are very useful in many applications to express domain-specific knowledge over data that may be incomplete, uncertain or even inconsistent because coming from autonomous data sources distributed over the Web. 

The proposed approach relies on recent complexity  results showing that the expressive power of ontologies must be limited for making tractable reasoning on data enriched with ontologies. In particular,  (several fragments of) the DL-Lite description logic  we have been studied  in the decentralized setting of P2P semantic networks. [1] designs a novel setting for robust module-based data management allowing to re-use a part of a  reference ontology-based data system as an independent module while guaranteeing that it evolves safely w.r.t both the reference  schema and its associated data. We are investigating how it applies to extract modules from the knowledge base on anatomy of My Corporis Fabrica.  [2,3 proposed a novel model of trust based on alignments between taxonomies for guiding the query answering process in P2P semantic networks. Finally,  [4]  provides a novel method that us systematic and mathematically well-founded for discovering mappings between taxonomies of classes. 

% We are also collaborating with Alexandre Termier and Noha Ibrahim on pattern-mining and semantic trace analysis.

\item[Webcontent] (RNTL, The semantic web framework-2006-2009), 10 partners(CEA LIST, EADS DCS, Thales Research \& Technology, France Telecom R \& D, ADRIA D\'eveloppement, Soredab SAS, Exalead, New Phenix, Xyleme, INRIA-GEMO, INRA, INRIA-Mostrare, LIP6, PRISM, INRIA-InSitu, LIG, LIMSI-CNRS, GRIMM, EXMO, PSY-CO), \\
(http://www.webcontent-project.org/), 83300 \texteuro. Coordinator: CEA, Scientific lead in LIG: Ch. Collet and M.-C. Rousset. 
The WebContent project is creating a software platform to accommodate the tools necessary to efficiently exploit and extend the future of the Internet: the Semantic Web. The first targeted domain is the watch, a subpart of intelligence dedicated to warn the decider on the occurrence of an event or the evolution of a situation. It joins several Open Source tools to create the core of a Service Oriented Application and it defines the interface of several services that are available through several partners, either freely or through commercial licences. These services then exchange data in a formalized manner.


\item[OPTIMACS]: (ANR, program ARPEGE 2008-2011), 3 partners (LIG, LAMIH, LIRIS),  (http://optimacs.imag.fr), 227 128 \texteuro. Coordinator: Grenoble INP-LIG, Scientific lead in LIG: G. Vargas-Solar. 
OPTIMACS (SERVICE COMPOSITION BASED FRAMEWORK FOR OPTIMIZING QUERIES) combines hybrid query processing and services composition, addressing services composition and query processing including adaptive hybrid query optimization according to QoS criteria. OPTIMACS is an original research project that will lead to results with an important expected impact on ``modern data and services intensive systems" deployed on networks of heterogeneous devices, the so called ecosystem or dataspaces.

\item[DATARING] (ANR, Programme R\'eseaux du futur et services 2008-2011), 3 partners (http://www.lina.univ-nantes.fr/projets/DataRing/). 130 549 \texteuro. Coordinator: INRIA Nantes, Scientific lead in LIG: M.-C. Rousset. 
The DataRing project addresses the problem of P2P data sharing for online communities, by offering a high-level network ring across distributed data source owners. Users may be in high numbers and interested in different kinds of collaboration and sharing their knowledge, ideas, experiences, etc. Data sources can be in high numbers, fairly autonomous, i.e. locally owned and controlled, and highly heterogeneous with different semantics and structures. What we need then is new, decentralized data management techniques that scale up while addressing the autonomy, dynamic behavior and heterogeneity of both users and data sources.

\item[CONTINUUM] (ANR, Programme R\'eseaux du futur et services 2008-2011),  7 partners (I3S, LIG, SUEZ ENVIRONNEMENT, LYONNAISE DES EAUX, GEMALTO, LUDOTIC, MOBILEGOV), (http://continuum.unice.fr), 279 652 \texteuro. Coordinator: University of Nice, Scientific lead in LIG: F. Jouanot and M.-C. Rousset. 
CONTINUUM (CONTINUITE DE SERVICE EN INFORMATIQUE UBIQUITAIRE ET MOBILE) addresses the problem of service continuity within the long-term vision of ambient intelligence. A core problem is to achieve software adaptation to a variety of resources in dynamic and heterogeneous environments with an appropriate balance between system autonomy and human control. Three key scientific issues will be addressed: context management and awareness, semantic heterogeneity, and human control versus system autonomy. The professions related to water management is used as a business application domain.

\item[UBIQUEST] (ANR, Programme BLANC 2009-2012), 3 partners (LIG, CITI, LIAMA), 149 099 \texteuro. Coordinator: Grenoble INP-LIG, Scientific lead in LIG: Ch. Bobineau and Ch. Collet.
UBIQUEST(Ubiquitous Quest: declarative approach for integrated network and data management in wireless multi-hop networks) aims at integrating network and data management in dynamic ad-hoc networks. this integration will be done by giving a distributed database view of the whole network. Each node stores network and application data in a local database. Messages between nodes are queries or answers. The objective of this integration is the rapid development and deployment of applications and network protocols.

QUALINCA is a ANR Contint funded research project looking at developing mechanisms allowing to quantify the quality level of a bibliographical knowledge base, to improve the afore mentioned quality level, to maintain the quality when updating the knowledge base and to exploit the knowledge bases taking into account their quality levels.
This project aims to develop mechanisms to:

- describe the quality of an existing document database;

- maintain a given level of quality by controlling updates on such databases;

- improve the quality of a database;

- exploit these databases according to their level of quality.


\item[ SocTrace] (2011-2015)  FUI-Minalogic, OSEO 2011-2015

Partners: INRIA, LIG, TIMA, STMicroelectronics, Magilem, probayes

Coordinator: STMicroelectronics

The SoC-Trace project aims to develop a set of methods and tools based on traces of execution produced by multi-core embedded applications. It will allow developers to optimize and debug these applications more efficiently. Such methods and tools should become a building block for the design of embedded software, in response to the growing needs of analysis and debugging required by the industry. The technological barriers consist of a scaling problem (millions of events stored on gigabytes) and a trace understanding problem related to applications whose complexity is increasing. The project addresses the problem of controlling the volume of tracks and of developing new analysis techniques. SocTrace is composed of academic partners with related themes, and several industry partners including STMicroelectronics.
